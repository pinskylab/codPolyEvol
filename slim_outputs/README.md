## SLiM outputs

Outputs from the SLiMulations complementing the empirical analysis of cod data.

Allele frequencies are in a similar format to the empirical allele frequencies - one file per timepoint*population x 20 replicates.

Fsts are recorded as all pairwise combinations for each timepoint*population*replicate.

[SLiM_MutationAges_3type.txt](https://github.com/pinskylab/codPolyEvol/blob/main/slim_outputs/SLiM_MutationAges_3type.txt) records type of mutation (QTL=m1, neutral=m2, deleterious=m3), prevalence, the simualted generation in which the mutation arose, and for QTL and deleterious mutants the effect size.
