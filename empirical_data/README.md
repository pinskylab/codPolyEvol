## Empirical genome-wide SNP data from Atlantic cod

Folders contain allele frequencies (one file per location*timepoint) calculated using various filtering schemes (either filtered for genotype quality only - "AllLoci" or "afreqs_all" - or filtered to minimize missing data in historical populations - "Can40").

The original (large!) VCF file is available [here](doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22006988)

Missingness files can be use to recreate the QC plots (Supp Figure 1).
